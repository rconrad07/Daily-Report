# Eval Notes for `

## Overall

- Stock section is "thin" with only 3 stocks, however the reason provided is valid. I really like that only tickers with significant activity are included. It tells me that the LLM is making good judgement calls.
- The AI Word of the Day has been disappointing  me in the latest reports. It's either too generic or feels repetitive to the AI section content. I'm looking for AI buzz words that are relevant to the AI industry and have not been used in the AI section content. Like "AGI", "GEO", "RAG", "Multimodal", "Diffusion Models", "Vector Database", etc. These are terms that are not frequently used in traditional software development, or there is an equivalent term, but was specifically designed for the AI development.
