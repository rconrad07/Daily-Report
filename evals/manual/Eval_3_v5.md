# Eval Notes from Feb 11

## Overall

- Let's rename the title of the reports as they appear in the sidebar of the html report. Rather than appears as "YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]", let's have it appear as "Month-DD". For example, the report from 2/10/2026 should be titled "Feb-10" instead of "2026-02-10 - Refined Layout". This is easily for me to type and increases the readability of the report titles.
- The URLs still don't work. Only 1 of the 6 provided actually work. The rest return a 404 error or homepage. This decreases the trustworthiness of the report if I cannot verify the information provided.
