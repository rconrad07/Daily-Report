# Here is my evaluation for Daily_Report_2026-02-09.md

## We need to start tracking model evals

- Create a directory for Evals (both for manual runs and one for an eval-arbiter agent)
- Create an eval-arbiter agent - an independent evaluation arbiter responsible for assessing the quality, correctness, and governance compliance of a completed multi-agent run. It is responsible or evaluting agent behavior, assessing the agents output for quality, and producing a structured, evidence based report into the cooresponding eval folder

## Add a new section to the report for "AI word of the day"
