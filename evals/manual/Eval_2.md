# Eval Notes

## Overall

- Great summary of topics. Felt like the right level of detail and length.
- Concepts were intriguing enough that I wanted to read more about them.

## Updates to make to the report

### Change the output format

- Leverage enterprise grade html
- Add a search bar so that I can search by report date or keyword
- Change the formatting of the stock section to be a table. I want to more easily be able to scan the stock prices and trends.
- I often want to read more about the topics presented, but cannot access the links to read the full articles. I need a better way to follow a link to the source.

### Automation

- I want the report to auto-run at 9am each day and produce a file in the `/reports` directory for me to read
