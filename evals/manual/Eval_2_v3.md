# Eval Notes

## Overall

- Correctly formatted the report based on prior instructions
- Tool Tip url's did not link to the article they were referencing but rather a generic url (e.g. homepage of a website rather than the article within the site)
- Move the search bar into the left nav bar instead of being in the top right
- The AI Knowledge section appeared in the wrong order. It should appear within the AI Tooling section.
- Rename "Intelligence Hub" to "Daily Report"
