# Eval Notes

## Overall

- Love the html format. The dark color scheme is great for my eyes.
- Search bar works, but not as expected. I want to be able to search by report date or keyword. More details on the behavior listed below.
- The amount of information in the html format felt skinnier than the markdown format. I felt like I was missing some information. Although that might just be my perception based on the new formatting style.
- The stock section was far too limited. I appreciated the additional information I received in the markdown format.

## Formatting changes to the report

- I don't like the 3 column view. This feels too restrictive to the sections. Allow each domain to appear as stacked blocks for more horizontal readability.
- The tool tip url link was superb from a UX perspective, however the link did not take me to the article it was referencing. Keep the link as a tooltip with a human-readable hyperlink, but the link should take the user to the article it was referencing.

## Search Bar Behavior

- I want a side nav bar that shows me all the previously generated reports. I want to be able to click on a report to view it.
- I want to be able to search by report date or keyword and be able to open it
