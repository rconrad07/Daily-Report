# Eval Report — 2026-02-09

- **Overall Score**: 85/100

## Quality Analysis

### Strengths

- **Expert Integration**: Successfully prioritized insights from key AI experts (Marty Cagan and Lenny Rachitsky) as requested in `ai_tooling.md`.
- **Formatting**: Premium Markdown styling with clear headings and consistent citation usage.
- **Tone**: Professional and concise, perfectly suited for the target Product Management audience.

### Weaknesses

- **Missing Requirements**: The "AI Word of the Day" and "Market Direction Baseline" sections are missing. This is likely because the report was generated before the latest template and prompt updates were successfully deployed in a full run.
- **Coverage**: While high quality, only 2 out of 15 specified AI experts were cited. Hopper (Hospitality) was missing due to search result gaps, which was correctly handled per execution rules but remains a content gap.

## Correctness Audit

- [x] **Track Stock Tickers**: All 10 tickers (including SPY/VIX) are present.
- [x] **AI Experts**: Cagan and Rachitsky insights included.
- [ ] **AI Word of the Day**: SECTION MISSING.
- [ ] **Market Direction Baseline**: Baseline opinion not explicitly separated as per the new template requirement.
- [x] **Hospitality Sources**: Covered Expedia, Booking.com, and Trivago.

## Research Quality

| Artifact | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Stock Market Watchlist | Pass | Accurate prices and news for all tickers. |
| AI Tooling Section | Pass | Strong synthesis of expert quotes and current trends (Claude/Cursor). |
| Hospitality Tech | Pass | High-signal updates on industry giants and trends. |
| AI Word of the Day | Fail | Requirement not reflected in output. |

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Re-run Pipeline**: Execute a fresh run of the orchestrator to trigger the updated Curator and Summarizer logic for AI Word of the Day and Market Baseline.
2. **Curation Logic**: Ensure the Curator agent is explicitly identifying a single "AI Word of the Day" to pass to the Summary stage.
3. **Template Sync**: Verify that the Formatter is correctly mapping the `{{AI_WORD}}` and `{{MARKET_DIRECTION_OPINION}}` placeholders from the Summary output.
