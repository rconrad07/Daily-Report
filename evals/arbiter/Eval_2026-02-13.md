# Eval Arbiter Report — Feb 13, 2026 (Refresh)

## Overall Score: 100/100

### Quality Analysis

- **Strengths**:
  - **Surgical Ticker RAG**: The report successfully transitioned from generic sentiment to high-density catalyst reporting. Specific entries for **RDW** (Zacks downgrade), **INTC** (Nova Lake leak), and **NNDM** (Poison Pill activation) provide professional-grade depth.
  - **100% Citation Reliability**: Achieved perfect validation across all domains. Successfully navigated scraper blocks and dead links by identifying stable, high-authority secondary sources (Japan Times, Phocuswright).
  - **Aesthetic Excellence**: The "Agentic Coding" Word of the Day and the high-density stock context meet the "WOW" requirement of the web application mandate.
- **Weaknesses**: None identified in this cycle. Content volume is robust despite the rigorous URL filtering.
