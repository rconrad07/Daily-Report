# Eval Report — 2026-02-10

- **Overall Score**: 97/100

## Quality Analysis

### Strengths

- **Zero Redundancy**: Successfully avoided repeating the "AI Word of the Day" and "Market Direction" from Feb 9. Transitioned from "Context Engineering" to "Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)."
- **Precision**: Met the new requirement to specify exact timeframes for stock movements (e.g., "up 3.38% today", "month-over-month", "recorded today").
- **Content Freshness**: Incorporated the Claude Opus 4.6 (released Feb 5) and Cursor's new "Agent Trace" spec, which were not in the previous report.
- **Expert Synthesis**: Evolved the Marty Cagan section to focus on the "Four Critical Risks," avoiding a repeat of the "Problem-First PRDs" summary from yesterday.

### Weaknesses

- **Source Depth**: While TNL and MSFT were well-covered, NNDM data was thin compared to other tickers due to limited daily reporting.

## Correctness Audit

- [x] **Market Direction Baseline**: Baseline set against SPY Pre-market ($695.56); accurately noted consolidation sentiment.
- [x] **AI Word of the Day**: **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — New and highly relevant to the PM focus.
- [x] **Zero Redundancy Check**: Verified against `Daily_Report_2026-02-09.md`. No duplicate news stories found.
- [x] **Stock Watchlist**: 7 major tickers covered with specific time-based movement data.
- [x] **Hospitality Sources**: Covered Expedia's PT hike, Booking.com's "Hushed Hobbies" trend, and Trivago's revenue surge.

## Research Quality

| Artifact | Pass/Fail | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Market Direction Baseline | Pass | Accurately baseline against SPY (+0.23%) and VIX compression. |
| AI Word of the Day | Pass | Pivot to GEO shows high contextual awareness of new PR trends. |
| Stock Market Watchlist | Pass | Mandatory timeframe labels included in every bullet point. |
| AI Tooling Section | Pass | Excellent update on Cagan's risk framework vs yesterday's PRD focus. |
| Hospitality Tech | Pass | Included "Hushed Hobbies" and Canary Technologies updates. |

## Actionable Recommendations

- **Search Optimization**: Add "Hopper app mobile travel trends" to future search queries to close the gap on the specific source.
- **Expert Depth**: Consider rotating the AI experts cited (currently heavily biased toward the top 2) to increase the breadth of the `ai_tooling.md` list.
