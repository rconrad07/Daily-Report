# Eval Arbiter Report — 2026-02-26

## Overall Score: 85/100

**Hard Caps Applied**:

- None. (Citations are stable, though 2/4 are section/homepages rather than deep article links, which caps the score at 85 rather than 100).

## Quality Analysis

- **Strengths**: The executive summary is punchy and factually grounded in today's earnings and news. The Stock Performance section correctly identifies the bearish baseline and provides precise premarket data for RDW and INTC. The premium styling of the HTML report is maintained.
- **Weaknesses**: Two citation links point to high-level pages (Anthropic News and Trip.com) rather than specific deep articles to ensure 100% uptime, which is a trade-off for reliability over depth.
