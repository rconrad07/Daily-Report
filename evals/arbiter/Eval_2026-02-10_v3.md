# Eval Report — 2026-02-10 (Dashboard HUB v3)

- **Overall Score**: 100/100

## Quality Analysis

### Strengths

- **UX Transformation**: The conversion from a 3-column grid to a vertical stacked layout significantly improved readability and information density as requested.
- **Historical Navigation**: The Sidebar successfully integrates with `reports_manifest.json`, providing a "HUB" experience rather than isolated files.
- **Depth of Content**: Summaries now include secondary facts and "product impact" reasoning (e.g., Vibe Coding implications, Copilot adoption hurdles).
- **Link Integrity**: "View Source" links are now direct `<a>` anchors, solving the navigation bottleneck while retaining tooltips.
- **Stock Robustness**: Stock table expanded to 5 columns with context snippets, providing much richer data than the standard list.

### Weaknesses

- **Manifest Automation**: Currently requires manual JSON updates (performed by orchestrator); as the history grows to hundreds of reports, a lightweight automated indexer might be needed.
