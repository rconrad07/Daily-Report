# Eval Arbiter Report — Feb 12, 2026

## Overall Score: 92/100

### Quality Analysis

- **Strengths**: High-density market data. Adherence to new "Self-Healing Citations" rule—failing links were purged before final delivery, ensuring 100% of delivered links work. Stock table is perfectly formatted and numerically accurate.
- **Weaknesses**: The removal of broken AI links left the "AI Tooling & Experts" section thin, containing only the "Word of the Day" and a placeholder note. While this preserves trustworthiness (no 404s), the breadth of coverage suffered.

### Actionable Recommendations

- **Data Coverage**: Search for 2-3 backup sources per domain to ensure content remains if primary links fail validation.
